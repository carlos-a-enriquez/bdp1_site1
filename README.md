# Site 1

Here I will carry out the computational challenge for site 1. 


/home/arturo.carlosenriquez/condor/comp_challenge


### Testing larger files


To test the effect of using larger files, now a file containing all reads from patients 1,2 and 3 will be created.
This file will be submitted as a single job, but queued several times. Then, we will test the effects of more and less worker nodes. 

The corresponding files will be called:

bwa_batch_1500.job
align2.py
